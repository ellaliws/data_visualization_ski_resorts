        This geometric visualization allows you to virtually traverse the ski resorts in the United States.
        As you hover through the map, you can explore different locations and some 
        other features such as the summit and acres of each resort.

        Some Insights:<br/>
        - By looking at the color density of the states, you can identify some states with more ski resorts.<br/>
        - You can also locate a resort on the map or explore other ski resorts near some areas!<br/>
        Some states have high density of ski resorts, such as Colorado, Michigan, and New York.<br/>
        - Some ski resort that are really close on the map may have similar summit because their location 
        have similar terrain. For example, resorts named Vail and Aspen Mt in Colorado state have similar summit(top elevation) around 11000 feet.

      <h1 class="section-title">Unveiling the Slope Levels - Find Your Perfect Challenge!</h1>
      <p class="section-text">
        Besides the North America, Europe may be the most well-known destination for skiing.
        For ski lovers, it can be fun to explore some locations in Europe for skiing. 
        Important information can include the difficulty levels of the ski slopes in the ski resorts.
        As we can usually see in a ski resort, there are signs to show three different difficulty levels 
        for the ski routes. <br/>
        - Green slopes and runs are friendly to beginners.<br/>
        - Blue slopes are at an intermediate level where slightly steeper slopes can be experienced.<br/>
        - Black slopes are advanced and for experts<br/>
        The lengths of these slopes are measured in kilometers.
         <br/>
        This visualization aims to deliver information about difficulty of ski slopes by country in Europe. So that
        we can all find our perfect challenge when exploring new places to have fun.

        <br/>
        For a ski beginner like me, you may want to look at only Easy Level of 
        these ski resorts. Click on the "Easy" buttons to see the total KMs of Easy runs 
        in each European country. To see all difficulty levels, click on "All Levels". <br/>
        <br/>

        Some Insights:<br/>
        Compare different countries’ ski resorts: they have different proportions.<br/>
            of difficulty levels, which depend on the location and the terrain.<br/>
        Countries with a lot of ski resorts：<br/>
        - We can see that Austria, France, and Switzerland have high total length of runs and slopes! 
        These countries have a lot of ski resorts! 
        If you want to explore many different places to ski, these countries may be good choices!

            Exploring more places to have fun is not all --
            this project believes in infusing a sense of pride for ski lovers! 
            A network will uncover the accomplishments of your home country in the Olympic Winter Games! 
            Your country might hold the game or win podiums. <br/>
            Hover through the green nodes to show the podiums of a nation has won. The orange nodes will 
            simply show that it has been a host country of Olympic Winter Game.
            Let’s enjoy our sport on the world stage!

        Some insights: <br/>
        - The thickness of the links represents the occurrence of winning a podium!<br/>
        - For example, Italy won 2 podiums in the 2002 Olympic Winter Game hosted in the United States. 
        So ITA has a thicker link towards United States<br/>
        - All links of Australia are thick! This means Australia won podiums multiple times in each game!
